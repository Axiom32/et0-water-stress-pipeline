# Evapotranspiration-Based Water Stress Pipeline

## Problem
Rainfall alone does not capture atmospheric water demand experienced by crops.
This project estimates reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) using the FAO-56
Penman–Monteith equation and identifies periods of high water stress risk.

## Approach
1. Compute daily ET₀ from meteorological data
2. Analyze temporal patterns and drivers
3. Define quantitative stress indicators
4. Predict short-term ET₀ dynamics

## Methods
- Physical modeling (FAO-56 Penman–Monteith)
- Time-series analysis
- Supervised learning for ET₀ forecasting

## Status
🚧 In progress
